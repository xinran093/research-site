**Social annotation** refers to the application of web annotation technologies in educational settings to support student interaction around course materials and with each other. It is a genre of information technology that allows a user to annotate information in a shared document and anchor a discussion to the annotated information. When it is used socially in online classrooms, it can support social reading, group sensemaking, knowledge construction, community building, and collaborative learning.

Since 2020, we have been collaborating with instructors from various institutions to support the design and facilitation of social annotation activities, aiming to engage college students in reading and discussing course materials. Following a co-design approach, we design both pedagogical and technological innovations, leveraging web annotation tools such as [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/) and [Perusall](https://www.perusall.com/).
